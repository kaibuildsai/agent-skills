# Agent Skills

Practical skills I built for my own daily use with coding agents (Claude Code, OpenClaw, Codex, etc.) to boost productivity.

## What is this?

- **Real problems, real solutions**: workflows I actually use
- **Minimal setup**: clear structure, easy to understand
- **Open to reuse**: copy, modify, adapt as needed

## Skills

### [wechat-article-reader](./wechat-article-reader/)
Extract full text from WeChat Official Account articles (`mp.weixin.qq.com`) → clean Markdown.

**Use cases**: Save articles, summarize with LLMs, convert to searchable text, Q&A over extracted content.

### [openclaw-agent-onboarding](./openclaw-agent-onboarding/)
Turn OpenClaw into a role-based multi-agent team. Each group auto-routes to the right agent.

**Use cases**: Role-isolated agents, avoid manual `/model` switching, group-specific routing.
